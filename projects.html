            <h3>Baseball Game Simulator</h3>
            <p>This simulator uses a random number sequence to generate different baseball plays and allow its user to simulate a baseball game. Games can be either 3, 6, or 9 innings, and games can go into extra innings if needed. Users can manually fill a team with player names or upload a roster to a team from the menu screen. The simulator will keep track of all batter and pitcher stats throughout the game, and users can view these stats at the conclusion of the game. The algorithm for this simulator was developed in C, and then converted to Java.</p>

            <h3>Baseball Season Simulator</h3>
            <p>This simulator allows its users to simulate a full 162 game MLB season along with full playoffs. Uses team winning percentages as ratings to create realistic aspect where teams with better ratings will likely win more games than teams with lesser ratings, but still leaves the possibility of outliers competing in the standings. Teams are shuffled and matched together 54 different times to create 162-game schedule. Top seeds from each league make playoffs following MLB playoff seeding implemented in 2022. Coded in Java.</p>

            <h3>ODHS Medicine Tracker</h3>
            <p>I was partnered with 5 other classmates in my Software Engineering course (Fall 2023) to create software for the Old Dominion Humane Society, a non-profit animal shelter in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Together, we designed software that tracks medical information for all of the animals in the humane society, keeping them up to date on vaccinations and medical needs. ODHS staff can create, edit, delete, and archive animals as needed, create appointments for animals, and the software sends notifications to the staff upon logging in when animals appointments are either close to due, due that day, or overdue so that ODHS staff can stay on top of their patients.</p>
