            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Riley Tugeau (Last name pronounced "2-Go"), and I'm a 25-year old computer scientist from Williamsburg, Virginia. I'm hard-working, motivated, and always try my best to have a smile on my face, and keep a smile on the faces of those around me. I have an identical twin brother (Christopher), and a younger brother (Coady). I love baseball and all things baseball, including my Baltimore Orioles. My hobbies include collecting baseball cards, playing baseball, and coding.</p>
            <h2>My Computer Science Story</h2>
            <p>Everyone in computer science has a story of how they got into the great big technological world of computer science, and here's mine. Coming out of high school, I was faced with uncertainty, but knew I wanted to go to college, and had the resources and people surrounding me to be able to do so. I attended Thomas Nelson (now Virginia Peninsula) Community College and received an Associates Degree in Social Sciences. I was accepted to the University of Mary Washington during the summer of 2020, but didn't attend until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Again, I headed into another institution uncertain of my future and went in undeclared. My love for baseball statistics led me to take Calculus during my first semester to see if a math major might be right for me. I also took Intro to Computer Science to complete the digital intensive course required as part of my general education classes. After managing a C in online Calculus, and acing the Computer Science intro course, my mind was made up. Three years later, I recieved my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and I couldn't be happier with the decision I made, and the amazing people I met along the way.</p>
